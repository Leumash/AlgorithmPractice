# Maximum Subarray Problem

In computer science, the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray w    ithin a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence     of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2,     1, with sum 6.
