# Subset Sum #

The Subset Sum is a special case of the Knapsack problem where the elements all have the same "price-per-pound".

In computer science, the subset sum problem is one of the important problems in complexity theory and cryptography. The problem is this: given a set (or multiset) of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero? For example, given the set {−7, −3, −2, 5, 8}, the answer is yes because the subset {−3, −2, 5} sums to zero. The problem is NP-complete.
